All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points.\n\n- A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies. \n\n- The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can’t move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage). \n\nthe tosculi hive-queen can’t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row."},{"name":"Regional Effects","desc":"the region containing a tosculi hive-queen’s lair is warped by the creature’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n- Intelligent creatures within 6 miles suffer frequent headaches.
